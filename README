A collection of simple programs that convert units.

== Description ==
These apps were intended to get me back into C++, and in particular with
implementing quick command line interfaces. I wanted to write simple apps
that have been sitting in the back of my head for a while, which could
later be used as a library of source code for bigger projects.

== Usage ==
Example:
    -- length --
        ./convert-length -h
        ./convert-length 1.0 m in
        ./convert-length 1.0 meter inch

    -- temperature --
        ./convert-temperature -h
        ./convert-temperature 0.0 c f
        ./convert-temperature 0.0 celsius fahrenheit

== Installation ==
I developed this project in Linux (Ubuntu 10.04).

 = Prerequisites =
 The following libraries or programs were what I used.

 - libboost-program-options-dev (Ubuntu package - Boost version 1.40)
 - CMake    (cmake version 2.8.0)
 - make     (Make 3.81 built for i486-pc-linux-gnu)
 - g++      (gcc version 4.4.3 (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5))

To build:
 1. cd /path/to/respective/app/CMake
    example:
        cd /usr/src/convert/length/CMake
 2. cmake ..
 3. make
